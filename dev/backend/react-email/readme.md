# React Email Starter

A live preview right in your browser so you don't need to keep sending real emails during development.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```sh
pnpm i
```

Then, run the development server:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

If you want to export when you're done, run:

```sh
pnpm export
```

Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
